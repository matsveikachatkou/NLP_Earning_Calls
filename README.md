# DAFA CASE 2

## Project

Earnings conference calls are regular quarterly meetings between the senior management teams of a company and their equity analysts. Compared to firm’s other types of disclosures, earnings calls are indeed very informative for market participants, as they contain more forward-looking details about the firm’s expected performance and direction. Earnings calls usually begin with the management presenting the previous quarter’s earnings results followed by a Q&A session between the management and participants.

The aim of the project is:

1. Parse the textual data from the xml files.
2. Separate the management presentation section from the Q&A section.
3. Check a pattern in length of presentations and Q&As based on the banks’ profitability.
4. Check a pattern in the tone/sentiment for the presentations before and during the 2008 financial crisis.
5. Find associations between the banks’ culture (e.g., a dictionary analysis based on Li et al. (2021)) and banks’ failure risk2 during the crisis.
6. Find which management teams have the most similar language to the man- agement of Lehman Brothers.
